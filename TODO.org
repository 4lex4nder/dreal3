* TODO Add .dr parser
	- yes lets put the parser outside. 
* TODO Add DR theory solver
* TODO fix .dr parser to support ITE properly
	- if we have a clean data structure, we don't have intermediate variables and the ITEs would be properly handled. 
* TODO refactor code to remove unnecessary global variables
	- We don't have those global variables yet now. 
* TODO interface between opensmt and realpaver
	- need an rp_solver class that can take in literals and call realpaver to check for consistency
	- each solving step in realpaver should be logged. 
	- assert and backtrack utilities
* TODO language binding for C/C++/OCaml
