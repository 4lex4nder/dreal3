\section multiprec_requirements Requirements
To use multiple-precision you need to install packages
  - libgmp, libgmp-dev
  - libgmpxx
  - libmpfr, libmpfr-dev.
.
<i>They can be also compiled and installed from sources even under Windows,
but in this tutorial we assume for simplicity that you are under Linux.</i>

First of all you need to compile <tt>mpcapd</tt> library. To do in the <tt>make</tt> directory invoke command
\code
make mpcapdlib target=X11
\endcode
Then you simply link your programs additionally with this library.

\section multiprec_datatypes Multiple-precision data types

The CAPD library uses generic programming (templates) therefore switching from double precision to multiple precision is really simple.
You only have to replace the base building blocs (types) of the CAPD classes.

Use capd::multiPrec::MpReal instead of \b double. MpReal is a C++ class which represents <b>m</b>ultiple-<b>p</b>recision
<b>f</b>loating point number with correct <b>r</b>ounding.

To define multiple-precision interval you can write
\code
typedef capd::intervals::Interval<capd::multiPrec::MpReal> MpInterval;
\endcode
Then in your code use \p MpInterval instead of \p DInterval (interval with double precision endpoints).
To define \p MpInterval include <b>capd/interval/MpInterval.h</b> instead of <b>DoubleInterval.h</b> or <b>Interval.h</b>.

If you use typedef's in your programs then most probably you need to change only two lines.


\section multiprec_example Examples

The following examples shows how to define multiple-precision variables, initiate them and use them as base types for other CAPD classes: Interval, Vector and Function.

These examples can be found in the <b>capd/example/multiprecExample</b> directory.

To compile first example one can invoke:
\code
g++ -o mpExample1 mpExample1.cpp -D__HAVE_MPFR__ -s -O2 -Wall -frounding-math \
  -I. -ICAPD_DIR/include   CAPD_DIR/lib/libmpcapd.a  -lmpfr -lgmp
\endcode
where CAPD_DIR is a root directory of the CAPD library.

You can also use the CAPD automated compilation system:
- in the <tt>makefile</tt> define that additionaly to capd these programs use <tt>mpcapd</tt> library (see <tt>examples/multiprecdemo/makefile</tt>)
\code
LIBRARY = mpcapd capd
\endcode
- invoke
\code
make target=X11 multiprecision=1
\endcode
  when standing in the <b>capd/example/multiprecExample</b> directory. <br>
  The <tt>multiprecision=1</tt> parameter:
  - defines needed symbol <tt>__HAVE_MPFR__</tt>,
  - links with the gmp and mpfr libraries,
  - can be shortened to <tt>mp=1</tt>.

\section ex3_1 Basic usage of multiple precision floating points
\dontinclude mpExample1.cpp

First we include definition of MpReal and define shorter name MpFloat
\skipline MpReal.h
\until MpFloat

Then we  set precision to 100 mantisa bits (about 30 decimal digits)
\skipline setDefaultPrecision
and we set MpFloat to round numbers to the nearest representable.
\skipline setDefaultRndMode

Now we create several MpFloat objects using different possible constructors
\skip MpFloat a
\until long double type

and print them on a screen 
\skip cout
\until << "\n e = "

\section ex3_2 Intervals with multiple-precision endpoints

\dontinclude mpExample2.cpp
\skip capd/interval/MpInterval.h
\until }

\section ex3_3 Multiple-precision vectors and functions 
\dontinclude mpExample3.cpp
\skip capd/multiPrec/MpReal.h
\until }

\section ex3_4 Multiple-precision types from the mpcapd library
Instead of including a lot of header files, "building" your own types and defining new names for them (using typedef),
you can include just one header file
\code
#include "capd/mpcapdlib.h"
\endcode
and use types which are included in the mpcapd library. It lets you to start writing your code without
repeating every time the same tedious things (i.e. including a lot of files and making many typedefs).
It also shorten compilation time, because they are not recompiled when
your program is built.

In general names defined in the mpcapd library agree with those defined in examples above,
with one difference: they are defined in the <tt>capd</tt> namespace.
Therefore you can simply replace all "includes" and "typedefs" in the above examples by two lines
\code
#include "capd/mpcapdlib.h"
using namespace capd;
\endcode
and they should compile and work exactly the same.

The naming convention is as follows:
- <tt>MpFloat</tt> is the name of the base multiple precision type,
- if <tt>CLASS</tt> is the name of the template class then the name of a multiple precision type will be
  - <tt>MpCLASS</tt>  for "nonrigorous" type   <br>
    <i> e.g. MpInterval, MpVector, MpMatrix, MpFunction, MpMap, MpTaylor etc.</i>
  - <tt>MpICLASS</tt> for rigorous, interval type<br>
    e.g. MpIVector, MpIMatrix, MpIFunction, MpIMap, MpITaylor etc.

Remark: Not all possible templates are compiled into mpcapd library e.g vectors of a fixed size are not included.
Instead we include only those that are often used. The list of types and their names can be found in the <tt>mplib.h</tt> file
in the "include" directory of the corresponding module (e.g. <tt>capd/include/interval/mplib.h</tt>).

\dontinclude mpExample4.cpp

\skip mpcapdlib
\until }
