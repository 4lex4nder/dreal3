/*! \page capd_facades  Facades

The source code of the CAPD library heavily uses advanced template techniques. 
If you are beginner in the C++ programming, the facade module is for you. 
This module might be a bit slower (up to 10%) than the regular classes 
but it provides non-template interfaces for most often used classes from the CAPD library. 
It can be also recommended for a user who just would like to try the CAPD library.
